# Two-level-bind target audit for this project's dyld userland.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (DAR-217, 2026-09-02). ld64 and real dyld disagree about
# how far to search when resolving a two-level-namespace bind, and the
# disagreement is completely silent until the process launches:
#
#   * ld64, resolving an undefined symbol, searches the transitive
#     LC_LOAD_DYLIB closure of every dylib on the link line, in order --
#     then records the bind against whichever dylib was LISTED, not
#     against the one that actually defines the symbol.
#   * real dyld-940, resolving that bind, looks only inside the named
#     image and the images it RE-EXPORTS (LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB). A plain
#     LC_LOAD_DYLIB dependency of the named image is not searched.
#
# So a symbol that is a real export of dylib B, reached at link time
# through dylib A because A plain-links B, links clean, `nm` clean, and
# then aborts before main():
#
#     dyld[7]: Symbol not found: ___assert_rtn
#       Referenced from: /usr/sbin/syslogd
#       Expected in: /usr/lib/system/libdispatch.dylib
#
# That is the real failure this script was written after: libdispatch.dylib
# plain-links (does not re-export) libsystem_malloc.dylib, which is the
# only image in this project exporting ___assert_rtn, and syslogd.macho
# listed libdispatch.dylib before libsystem_malloc.dylib on its link line.
# Fix is always to LIST the real owning dylib earlier on the link line
# (build_syslogd.sh's own "ORDER MATTERS" comment) -- never to add a
# re-export to an unrelated dylib just to make the bind resolve.
#
# As a launchd job this class of failure is close to invisible: the abort
# shows up only as a bare "Failed to send exception EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY.
# error code: 5 for pid N" line on the console, with no symbol name and no
# image name anywhere. Running the same binary by hand from the root shell
# is what surfaced the real dyld message. This script finds the same thing
# from the build host in seconds -- same motivation as gap_audit.sh and
# weak_def_audit.sh, and it deliberately reuses weak_def_audit.sh's
# install-name index/closure shape rather than inventing another one.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/userland_staging/bind_target_audit.sh [image ...]
#
# With no arguments, audits every .dylib under libc_build/system/, every
# .macho in libc_build/ and tools/userland_staging/, and every target
# (non-macOS-platform) Mach-O anywhere else under libc_build/ -- the staged
# trees inject_into_sd_image.sh copies onto the image (x11/server/root,
# gnustep/root, fontstack/...). Those were not swept before DAR-447, and a
# relink sweep missed Xorg/Xvfb there: the real Pi then aborted Xorg at
# dyld load ("Symbol not found: _atan2, Expected in libsystem_c.dylib").
#
# Exit status is 1 if any image has an unresolvable two-level bind.
#
# NOT checked here (each has its own tool/reason):
#   <weak-def-coalesce>  -- weak_def_audit.sh
#   <flat-namespace>     -- a real, deliberate `-Wl,-U` deferral in
#                           several build_*.sh scripts; resolution is
#                           process-wide, not per-image
#   <this-image>         -- self/umbrella bind, resolved through the
#                           image's own re-exports; checked, since that is
#                           the same re-export walk
set -uo pipefail
# Florence: vendored from the iokit repo's tools/userland_staging/bind_target_audit.sh

# resolves, takes image paths relative to Florence's own tree, and indexes
# Florence's dylibs ($FLORENCE_LIBS, default build/root/usr/local/lib) as well.
